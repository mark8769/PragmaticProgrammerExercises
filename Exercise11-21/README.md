# Exercise 11 Article 21(Text Manipulation) pg.99

"You're rewriting an application that used to use YAML as a configuration language. Your company has now standardized on JSON, so you have a bunch of .yaml files that need to be turned into .json. Write a script that takes a directory and converts each .yaml file into a corresponding .json file (so database.yaml becomes database.json, and the contents are valid JSON).'"
